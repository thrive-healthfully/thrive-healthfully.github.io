    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In August of 2006 I was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis (arthritis). The doctors initially thought I broke my left big toe until my right big toe similarly ballooned days later. As my arthritis travelled to other, larger joints in my body, I developed psoriosis, a minor annoyance, as well as depression, a much larger annoyance. Though my body was clearly sending me plenty of warning signs, I continued to live a normal life: that is, eating a standard American diet, neglecting my sleep, stress, and environmental toxins. In January of 2013 I was diagnosed with Crohn&rsquo;s Disease. At the time, doctors told me it was quite severe &ndash; I had a narrowing in my large intestine that would almost surely lead to a blockage and require hospitalization and a partial or complete removal of my colon. severe enough for me to go on mesalamin and Humira &ndash; a combination that is now casually prescribed to patients. Mesalamine. That&rsquo;s three autoimmune diseases before the age of 21.</p>

<p>Since then, I have taken to an elimination diet (AIP paleo) popularized by Paleo Mom, and I haven&rsquo;t looked back since &ndash; well, only a few times. It is nearly one year later and I can say that all of my diseases are improved and I am gearing up to go off of my medication.</p>

<p>This blog is only tangentially about me though &ndash; mostly how my experiences can help you and draw connections between your experiences and mine. Really, the goal of this blog is to find and give support for those trying to give their bodies the necessary materials to heal themselves au natural. I hope to provide tips and strategies to help people be compliant in their day to day lives, help them regain control when we cheat (it&rsquo;s inevitable), and motivate. I strongly suggest subscribing to /r/AutoimmuneProtocol, or following me on twitter</p>
